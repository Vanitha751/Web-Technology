        The World Wide Web (WWW or simply the Web) is an information system that enables content sharing over the
        Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists.[1] It allows
        documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet according to specific rules of the Hypertext
        Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[2]Ancient manuscripts also divided sentences into paragraphs with line breaks
        (newline) followed by an initial at

        the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter, sometimes outdented beyond the
        margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of Beowulf.
        Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not commonly.[3] Modern English typography usually
        indicates a new paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States
        Constitution from 1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the
        inter-paragraph white space, or put in the indentation space.

        A second common modern English style is to use no indenting, but add vertical white space to create "block
        paragraphs." On a typewriter, a double carriage return produces a blank line for this purpose; professional
        typesetters (or word processing software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading. This
        style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the World Wide Web and email. Wikipedia itself employs
        this format.</p>
