        Web design is the planning and creation of websites. This includes a number of separate skills that all
        fall under the umbrella of web design.
        These skills are information architecture, user interface, site structure, navigation, layout, colors,
        fonts, and overall imagery. All of these skills are combined with the principles of design to create a website
        that meets the goals of the company or individual from whom that site is being created.

            </ul><b>Web Design Has Many Different Roles:</b>When you work as a web designer, you may be tasked with
            creating (or working on) entire sites or just individual pages and there is a lot to learn to be a
            well-rounded
            designer, including the following:
            <b>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>HTML:</li>
                </ol>
            </b> This is the structure of web pages, creating the foundation of all websites.
            <strong>
                <ol type="1" start="2">
                    <li>CSS:</li>
                </ol>
            </strong> is how web pages are visually styled. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) handles the entire look
            of sites, including layout, typography, colors, and more.
            <b>
                <ol type="1" start="3">
                    <li>JAVA SCRIPT:</li>
                </ol>
            </b> This governs certain behaviors on websites and can be used for a variety of interactions
            and features.
            <b>
                <ol type="1" start="4">
                    <li>CGI programming:</li>
                </ol>
            </b> and the next few entries (PHP, ASP, etc.) are all different flavors of
            programming languages. Many sites do not require any of these languages, but sites that are more
            feature-rich will certainly need to be coded using some of these languages.

        <dt>Desktop applications:</dt>
        <dd>Desktop applications are programs or software that runs locally on a computer after
            installation. These applications take space on the hard drive of the computer and generally run without an
            internet connection. However, some desktop applications may require an internet connection forupdates and
            some like web browsers are functional only in presence of an internet connection. Microsoft Office
            applications, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, media players, etc. are a few examples of desktop
            applications.

            <strong><b>Web applications:</b></strong> Web applications are not required to be installed in the computer
            and are accessible
            through web browsers in the presence of an internet connection. Contrarily to desktop apps, web applications
            take space on the server. As most of the web applications are designed to be responsive, interactive, and
            can run on computers, mobile devices, and all other devices with a web browser, they are considered to be
            the modern form of computer applications and their use is massively growing day by day. Google docs,
            YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, etc. are a few examples of web applications

        <dd>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
            structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
            appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between
            websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
            pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</dd>

        <dd>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
            researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
            hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That
            year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for
            funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed
            "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]

            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on
            the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
            relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid,
            an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these
            elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]

            HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material
            into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the
            browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of
            CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using
            SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF
            command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These
            formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents.
            However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with
            attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been
            progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</dd>

        <dd>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet
            Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification,
            the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an
            SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft expired after six months, but was
            notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images,
            reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's
            competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing
            already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]

            After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this
            working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard
            against which future implementations should be based.[12]

            Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML
            specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C).[13] In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was
            published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in
            the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the
            W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.[14]</dd>

            In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" <p> and
                "end tag" </p>. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.

            Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text.
            This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.

            The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information,
            such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the
            presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the <img> used to embed images, the reference to the
            image resource in the format like this: <img src="example.com/example.jpg">

            Some elements, such as the line break <br />, or <br /> do not permit any embedded content, either text or
            further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.

            Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element <p>, are optional.
                An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the
                structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most
                HTML authors.

                The general form of an HTML element is therefore: <tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">
                    ''content''</tag>. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form <tag
                    attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2">. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the
                    <br /> tag or the inline <img> tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. The
                    end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, /, and that in empty elements the end tag is
                    neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.
